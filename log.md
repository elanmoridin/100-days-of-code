# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked with puppet a bit to play around with how it works

**Thoughts**: It's interesting and I'm excited to do a bit more with it in the future to explore around. I built a puppet instance in
my Linux (Ubuntu) box using Virtual Box and Vagrant.

### Day 2: January 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I did some more exporation through Node to go back over what I know and explore a few new things that I haven't used
in a while. I also fixed an error with my wsl subsystem on my Windows computer caused by Docker and wsl not playing well after a docker container stopped working unexpectantly. 

**Thoughts** Node is robust system I knew but I had forgotten some of the basics that I picked back up on goign through different documentation

### Day 3: January 21th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to take dive into hooks in React. I played around a bit with useEffect and useState.

**Thoughts** React hooks are a very useful tool to use. They make navigating and raising states a much easier affair

### Day 4: January 22th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today was a change of pace away from technical coding and covering more of interviews and how to handle them. I did a hackerrank challenge and read up on a few different strategies from around YouTube and a few books.

**Thoughts** Interviews are draining

### Day 5: January 23th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through a link of Javascript Interview questions to see if I could answer them all and read up on all the ones I couldn't come up with off the top of my head.

**Thoughts** A nice catch up on things

### Day 6: January 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today was trying out a few problems at Code Academy just to stay sharp on a day where I've been much more busy than expected. But it's important to take a little bit of time to at least keep the progress going!

**Thoughts** just a catch up from a busy day
