# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked with puppet a bit to play around with how it works

**Thoughts**: It's interesting and I'm excited to do a bit more with it in the future to explore around. I built a puppet instance in
my Linux (Ubuntu) box using Virtual Box and Vagrant.

### Day 1: January 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I setup some docker containers for a few different items.

**Thoughts** Using Docker created and expanded upon some setup for a VPN, Radarr, Sonaar, and Plex

### Day 2: January 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I did some more exporation through Node to go back over what I know and explore a few new things that I haven't used
in a while. I also fixed an error with my wsl subsystem on my Windows computer caused by Docker and wsl not playing well after a docker container stopped working unexpectantly. 

**Thoughts** Node is robust system I knew but I had forgotten some of the basics that I picked back up on goign through different documentation
